                <li><span>Make the server from which a direct message was sent from unrecognizable.</span><br>As Katzumi
                    always includes the server from which a direct message was sent from to ensure that users can keep
                    track of which servers are sending messages to them, you have to make sure that every direct message
                    you sent using Katzumi is clearly identifiable as a message from your server.</li>
